            <p>My user-test part mainly focused on these three-section: operating experience, button position, and overall design style. For the operating part, based on the feedback I received from my tester, it’s smooth and every step is reasonable. I only have one button for this project which is the back button placed on the upper left corner of the overlay, and the only suggestion for this button is to match its font style with the subtitle. The overall design style is welcome, tester said that the animation of the plane reduced the negative space of the main page.</p>
            <p> There is a small problem with the text overlay that will appear when the mouse is within the photo div because the area of the photo div is very wide so it’s easy to activate
                the text overlay.</p>  
                  <p> Based on the feedback, I plan to modify the font style of the back button to make it inline. Also am going to refine the text overlay, to see what is the best way to do it.</p>
