                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p> This project is to present part of my travel experience in the past few years. I use the reserved ticket to wake up the memory, and share them with audience.</p>

                <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>   
                    <p>This travel blog is a very concise and clear design, because the most prominent content of it are photos and memories , so there is no need to add fancy decorations. Each photo is like a footprint, placed on the timeline in chronological order, and each photo is accompanied by a memory.
                        However, since this is an ordinary blog, he does not have many interactive modes.
                        The design of my work is very similar to it in simple style, and the main content is also to record the scenery and memories of travel.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My work combines the ideas of these two case websites to some extent. Before showing the audience my memories, let them choose a ticket before seeing my travel memories. The difference is that I did not include a lot of text, nor did I have a random sticky note design.</p>

                <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
                <p>The interface layout design in the middle of this website is very similar to my idea. But her notepapers are more random. The selected picture will be displayed on the top, this design is very interesting. I was planning to place my ticks like that, but my tickets are all white, it is too messy to achieve such an effect. If I have enough time or in the future design, I will turn the ticket into a hand-painted one so that I will have more color options so I can edit it.
                    Also the colorful notepapers at the bottom of the website are very playful, because they hide in the screen edge, and use can randomly pick one.</p>

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>              
                        <p>The overall style of my work is concise and clear. Everyone can guess that my website is about traveling based on the fly tickets they see. I use the blue font because it is the color of the sky, the white overlay is clouds, and the lavender background is the California sunset.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>   
                   <p>After opening the webpage, the user needs to select one of the tickets, and there will be a hover when choosing a ticket. After clicking the ticket, an overlay will appear showing the photo and location. Clicking on the photo with the mouse will show the character time and some memories. Then click the close sign to close the overlay and choose another ticket. Basically, the appearance of every element requires the user's operation to achieve.</p>

                <h2>Experience goals</h2>
                <p>I hope users will remember their travel experience after exploring my webpage. If they can, they will also look for the reserved ticket stubs, the photos they have taken, and remember the people  who traveled togetherï¼Œand the stories that happened at that time. In this era of advanced electronic equipment, paper tickets are more collectible at a certain level and can carry more memory.</p>
